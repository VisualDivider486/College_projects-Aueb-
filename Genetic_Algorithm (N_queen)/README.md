The N-queen problem is given the number Œù of queens (queen:pawn in chess) the program will have to fit them on a board N x N
in order not to be threaten by any queen already placed on the board.This problem had me buffled for a while as for what would be
the best algorithm to implement in order to have a good time complexity, and there comes to play its role the genetic algorithms.
