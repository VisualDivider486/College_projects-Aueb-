The following project was done in the second year of my studies and it's about a simple theatre ticket program  
which uses threads.This was my first introduction to the C language and it heleped me navigate through topics  
like memory managment,pthreads,sychronization and VMs (since the project had to be built in the same OS enviroment for better compatibilty)
